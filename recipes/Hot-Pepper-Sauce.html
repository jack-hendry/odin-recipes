            Trinidadians LOVE their 'peppa' sauce, and this one is full 
            of flavour and heat! Sooooo easy to make -- no cooking, just 
            your blender to create this taste of the islands. Try 
            using different peppers to vary the flavour and heat. 
            Use over meats, in sandwiches and stews. Trinis use it 
            in anything savoury!

            Serves: 100

            <li>1.5 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 limes, juiced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons dry mustard powder</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wearing disposable gloves, and being careful 
                not to get any in your eyes or on your skin, 
                roughly chop the habanero peppers. Place the habanero peppers, 
                mango, onion, green onions, and garlic into a blender. 
                Pour in the vinegar, lime juice, and vegetable oil, cover 
                the blender, and pulse until the mixture is very finely chopped. 
                Stop the blender, and add dry mustard powder, salt, 
                curry powder, and lime zest. Blend again until the sauce is 
                smooth. Pour into clean jars, and store in refrigerator.
