        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) frying chicken, cut up</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon celery seeds</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
            <li>2 cups Kikkoman Tempura Batter Mix</li>
        </ul>

                Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk, garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. Place chicken 
                in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander to remove 
                excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. Close top and gently 
                shake bag to coat chicken with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides.
